*Prompt: Pick a "dislike" of yours, then write a short piece presenting it —
what it is, why you dislike it so much. Write this very much as you would talk
to someone you know.*

My sister and I started piano lessons when I was eight and she was six years old.
It was a rainy summer day, for some reason that sticks in my memory. The two of
us huddled with our mom on the front steps of a little house on Bross Street.
White with black trim, like a piano key, I remember thinking. Excited and
anxious but soon at ease as we met our teacher, Virginia Zebolsky, for the first
time. We took turns at the upright piano, a blue booster cushion on its bench, a
rickety pedal extender box on the floor, playing our first five-finger
exercises.

The years flew by. Practice sheets, weekly goals, scales, cadences, repertoire
pieces. Weeknight lessons, and Saturday morning group classes that if at first
were a chore, being dragged out of bed so early, became something else as I got
older: an all-too-brief hour in the presence of my years-long crush, Brandy
Watson, the cute, quiet girl who sometimes played duets with my sister.

Every spring and fall, without fail, Virginia held a studio recital. The adult
students went first, then the kids, increasing in age and ability to the closer,
the finale, often a graduating senior. I would look up to them: Annie Clark
playing Mendelssohn, Meredith Laitos playing Debussy, Caitlin McGugan playing
Rachmaninoff. They seemed to have such confidence and poise, to be in such
control of the piano.

I would sit in the church pew waiting my turn in utter dread. I hated it, hated,
hated, hated it: the nerves, a burning in the chest and hands and shaking in the
knees. Walking up to the stage as if out of body, not just worrying I had
forgotten the notes but convinced of it. Waiting for a slip, fingers suddenly
clumsy and stiff, suddenly very aware of everyone in the audience, the keys a
blur.

The truth is a part of me would sit there and hope for it to happen to the other
students, to whoever went right before me. Could I have felt that about Brandy
Watson? My own sister even? It wouldn't surprise me. Hoping however I did might
not look so bad in comparison.

One time it was different. It was the final recital for Brandy and me, for the
first time we were the last two. We both played Preludes. She played Chopin and
played it beautifully, and I played Rachmaninoff, finally letting go of my
vanity and insecurity. Somehow merging with the music, my eighteen-year-old
hands big enough for the climactic chords, the awkward leaps. From some unknown
place, the delicate polyphony, the descending lines singing the overlapping
memories of my childhood, a journey back to a rainy summer day in a little white
and black house on Bross Street. There is a photo of Virginia and me in front of
the grand piano that captured the moment. It was something more than happiness,
with tears in both our eyes. It was a moment of joy.
